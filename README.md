🌐 Global EV Trends – EDA on IEA Global EV Dataset 2024 🚘⚡
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on electric vehicle (EV) trends using the IEA Global EV Dataset 2024. The goal of this analysis is to understand the global landscape of EV adoption, sales, infrastructure, and powertrain distribution across regions and time.

📌 Project Overview
This EDA project explores key questions like:

🌍 How has EV adoption changed over time globally?

🧭 Which regions are leading in EV sales, stock, and infrastructure?

🚗 What are the trends in powertrain technologies (BEV, PHEV, etc.)?

📈 What does the year-on-year growth of EVs look like?

🔌 How has the availability of charging infrastructure evolved?

The analysis is designed from a Business Analyst perspective, combining visual storytelling and data-backed insights to guide decisions and inform policy.

📊 Dataset Description
Source: Kaggle – IEA Global EV Dataset 2024

Attributes:

region – geographical area

category – vehicle type (cars, buses, etc.)

parameter – stock, sales, share, charging points

mode, powertrain – e.g., BEV, PHEV

year, value, unit

🔧 Tools & Technologies
Python

Pandas & NumPy – data preprocessing

Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly – for data visualization

Choropleth Maps – to represent regional adoption visually

Stacked Bar Charts, Treemaps – for parameter/category comparisons

Jupyter Notebook

📈 Key Insights (Sample)
EV stock and sales have shown consistent growth from 2010 to 2023.

China and Europe are leading in EV adoption.

Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) dominate over Plug-in Hybrid EVs (PHEVs).

Infrastructure (charging points) has significantly increased in recent years.

Visualization highlights include heatmaps, treemaps, choropleth maps, and trend lines.

🤖 Note:
Some parts of this project were enhanced using AI for guidance, explanation and for better analysis. However, all core logic, visualizations, and analytical thought processes were built and interpreted independently, reflecting my understanding of Python and EDA techniques.

💼 Learning Outcomes
Cleaned and transformed a complex real-world dataset

Created insightful visual dashboards for stakeholders

Improved proficiency in data analysis and Python visualization

Gained practical experience applying business questions to data
